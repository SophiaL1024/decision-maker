VALUES ('Avatar','Soon after hitting theaters in 2009, Avatar became one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Using the newly invented (at that time) motion capture technique, 3-D viewing and the use of stereoscopic filmmaking, it’s no surprise that the film won an Academy Award, in addition to several other awards for its visual effects. This film is available with audio description, and we highly suggest you take the time to listen to it!',2);

VALUES ('Avengers: Infinity War','With an estimated budget of $300 – $400 million, Marvel’s Infinity War is one of the most expensive movies ever created. Wondering why it cost so much? Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but those elaborate costumes and scenery were actually created digitally. It took 13 visual effects companies to create the incredibly detailed characters and scenes in this movie. Missing out on the astonishing visual effects in this movie is not only missing a huge part of what’s happening, but also missing out on brilliant works of art. The comparisons below show you what it actually looked like when filming, compared with what it looks like on screen. In many scenes, the footage was shot with green screens and minimal costuming, only to be digitally created later on.',2);

VALUES ('Star Wars: The Force Awakens','For any Star Wars fans, I probably don’t have to give you reasons why this is a movie to watch with audio description (and in any other format you can think of, for that matter.) But if you’re looking for another reason, consider the visuals.

The Star Wars opening crawl is the signature of every Star Wars movie, and has become an iconic symbol that even non Star Wars fans recognize. The opening crawl begins with the static blue text, “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….”. None of the text is spoken out loud, so for those with vision loss, this iconic on-screen text which provides crucial information to viewers is missed if it is not audio described.',2);

VALUES ('Frozen','I don’t know about you, but hearing Olaf described as “a carrot nosed snowman shuffling up to a purple flower” is enough of a reason that Frozen is a movie to watch with audio description. Thanks to Pixar’s Disney Movies Anywhere App, which allows users to watch most Pixar films with audio description, you can watch this all-time favorite with incredible descriptions. It really doesn’t get much cuter!',2);

This unique and complex film follows a thief with the rare ability to enter people’s dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. As you might imagine, this leads to a pretty interesting storyline. If you think you would be able to follow this sci-fi/thriller without description that makes one of us.',2);

VALUES ('The Hunger Games','Adapted from books which rely on internal monologue, The Hunger Games movie uses dialogue as well as visuals and cutaways to create a similar feel. In addition, although fewer than the number in the book there are several memory-laden flashbacks and a hallucination scene that would be difficult to understand without audio description. Compared to some of the others on this list, The Hunger Games may seem limited in its visual effects, but audio description is just as crucial to explain the context, for example in the scene depicted below where there is no dialogue as Katniss crosses a barbed wire fence with a sign on it that reads, “District Boundary No Access Beyond This Point” indicating possible danger ahead.',2);
